# Galactic Grease Monkey

This game will have a leaderboard that tracks the three highest scores achieved by playing. In order to achieve the highest score possible, the player can do three things to add to their score. The player must collect all spaceship parts in a given round, collect as many diamonds as they can before they disappear, and stay in the round for as long as they can until they deem it’s too dangerous to leave without being mauled by aliens. In a given round, the spaceship parts will remain static and be placed on a cell on the map at the start of the round. Rock walls and satellites will also be placed on the map and will block the user from crossing a series of cells and a single cell, respectively. The diamonds will continuously spawn and despawn on random cells on the map with a 5-second timer before they disappear. The aliens will continuously spawn after a certain interval of time and despawn only when they are killed by the main character. Spaceship parts add 100 points to your score, diamonds add 500 points to your score, and colliding with an alien or black hole will subtract 300 points from your score. The three highest scores will be displayed on the menu page of our game. There will be two/three rounds of the game and if the player’s score turns negative before they finish all the rounds, they lose the game.
